        <p><strong>What I Have Worked On</strong></p>
        <p>
          This week I started my CART 351 journey by setting up my GitHub repository and creating this website to record my weekly journal, exercises, and projects. I also experimented with CSS gradients and other design elements to create the navbar and header, trying to make the page visually appealing and cohesive.

        <p><strong>Challenges / Problems</strong></p>
        <p>
          One challenge I faced was making the webpage visually appealing. I do think it still needs some refining, but I am currently satisfied with the consistent look. Additionally, setting up the GitHub Pages was something I had done before, but I didn’t fully remember the process. Fortunately, I was able to figure it out with help from online tutorials.

        <p><strong>Goals for Next Week</strong></p>
        <p>
          Next week, I plan to improve my website further more and work on the first project and in-class exercises.

            <p><strong>What I Have Worked On</strong></p>
            <p>
              This week, I have worked with APIS, specifically the Weather API and the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API. I learned how to fetch data from this API with my teammate and display the information on the terminal. The exercise was interesting as it allowed me to understand how to interact with APIs and handle JSON data from external sources. I have also went through the Project 1 quickly, which looked pretty interesting.

            <p><strong>Challenges / Problems</strong></p>
            <p>
              The challenge I have faced while doing the Exercise 1 was following the many steps when working with the API. At first, the instruction felt long and I had to reread some steps carefully to make sure I didn't miss anything. Therefore, I had to slow down. Also, I found it was easy to get lost while reading the json output. <br/>
              I also didn’t have time to work on improving my website this week as I was busy with other assignments. I will try to work on it after submitting the project 1.

            <p><strong>Goals for Next Week</strong></p>
            <p>
              For next week, I will work on project 1.
