        <p><strong>What I Have Worked On</strong></p>
        <p>
          This week I started my CART 351 journey by setting up my GitHub repository and creating this website to record my weekly journal, exercises, and projects. I also experimented with CSS gradients and other design elements to create the navbar and header, trying to make the page visually appealing and cohesive.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Challenges / Problems</strong></p>
        <p>
          One challenge I faced was making the webpage visually appealing. I do think it still needs some refining, but I am currently satisfied with the consistent look. Additionally, setting up the GitHub Pages was something I had done before, but I didn’t fully remember the process. Fortunately, I was able to figure it out with help from online tutorials.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Goals for Next Week</strong></p>
        <p>
          Next week, I plan to improve my website further more and work on the first project and in-class exercises.

              This week, I have worked with APIS, specifically the Weather API and the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API. I learned how to fetch data from this API with my teammate and display the information on the terminal. The exercise was interesting as it allowed me to understand how to interact with APIs and handle JSON data from external sources. I have also went through the Project 1 quickly, which looked pretty interesting.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges / Problems</strong></p>
            <p>
              The challenge I have faced while doing the Exercise 1 was following the many steps when working with the API. At first, the instruction felt long and I had to reread some steps carefully to make sure I didn't miss anything. Therefore, I had to slow down. Also, I found it was easy to get lost while reading the json output. <br/>
              I also didn’t have time to work on improving my website this week as I was busy with other assignments. I will try to work on it after submitting the project 1.
              </p>
            <p><strong>Goals for Next Week</strong></p>
            <p>
              For next week, I will work on project 1.

            <p>
              This week, we learned about Flask and how to set up a basic web server using it. Flask makes it easier to create web applications with Python. The in-class exercise was helpful as it guided me through the process of setting up a Flask application and creating routes to handle different URLs easily. <br/>
              I have also read and explored the reading under "Bots and Chat titled <i>"Paolo Pedercini: LIKE LIKE neo arcade: The Online Museum of Multiplayer Art (2020)"</i> 
              (<a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/online-museum-multiplayer-art-viewing-experience-igame-1202687851/" target="_blank">link</a>).
              It was interesting to see how the Online Museum of Multiplayer Art (oMoMA) transforms the traditional idea of an art musuem into an interactive and multiplayer space. As the article mentions, LikeLike's aesthetic is very charming and has the feel of a video game. Visitors can move around and explore the virtual environment and interact with other's exhibitions, which makes it fun. It was fascinating to see how technology can be used to create new forms of art and experiences.

            <p>
              I did not run into any major challenges this week since the in class exercise was straightforward and easy to follow.

            <p>
              This week, I worked on Project 1 with my teammate. Our project is called <i><a href="./project/celine-tran-40296536-cathy-tham-40287326_project1/air_quest_game.py">AirQuest</a></i>, a terminal-based game that uses real-time air quality data from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API. The users can enter different cities and gain or lose health percentages depending on the air quality of the city. <br/>
              We also used PyFiglet, Rich, and Colorama to add visual with ASCII art, color-coded messages, and poetic warnings to make it a bit more fun to play. <br/>
              This project was really fun, and I learned a lot about the stylizing the terminal and making text-based games more engaging. The gamification part also made the experience a lot more interesting than simply printing data to the screen.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges / Problems</strong></p>
            <p>
              Working in the terminal was more challenging than I expected as there are some things we can't do easily, like precise layout or GIFs. It required some experimentation to make the visuals look good. Overall, I learned a lot through this project and had fun creating the game.

            <p>
              This week, we continued working with Flask and learned about how templates using Jinja connect with routes to create dymanic web pages. Also, I have worked on exercise 2, which helped me understand better how Python and HTML connects.
              <br/>
              I have also read and explored the reading under "Data & Collection"  titled <i>"Giorgia Lupi and Stephanie Posavec: Dear Data"</i> 
              (<a href="https://www.dear-data.com/theproject" target="_blank">link</a>).
              The project "Dear Data" is a very interesting exploration of personal data drawn on postcards exchanged between Giorgia Lupi and Stephanie Posavec over a year. Each week, they collected data about their daily lives, showing how data can be represented beautifully as emotions, interactions and habits instead of just numbers and charts. I found the hand-drawn postcards really beautiful and inspiring. They made me want to journal and use drawing as a way to express my feelings. This project is unique and makes data feel more personal, giving each one of them its own story. <br/>

              At first, I didn’t fully understand how passing variables from Python to HTML worked. However, after doing the the exercise, asking my teammate questions and experimenting a bit, I was able to grasp the concept better.

            <p>
              This week, we continued working with Flask and focused more on how to handle forms and user input using GET and POST methods. Also, we have learned about sessions and how they can be used to store user data across different pages. It helped me understand how websites "store" information temporarily without using a database, which is something new to me and would be very useful. We also looked at how Flask can communicate with JavaScript using Fetch API to send and received data without reloading the page. <br/>
              My teammate and I also started planning for Project 2, which is based on an idea we have for another class. Our project is a web application called Split Decision designed to make group decision-making easier, more engaging and fun. It will allow users to input data (where to eat for ecxample), play some quick games and see the final decision displayed at the end. <br/>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges / Problems</strong></p>
            <p>
              At first, I didn’t fully understand how everything worked. However, after going through the examples in class, I began to understand how JavaScript, HTML forms, and Flask routes work together to handle user input and display content afterwards.
