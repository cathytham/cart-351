        <p><strong>What I Have Worked On</strong></p>
        <p>
          This week I started my CART 351 journey by setting up my GitHub repository and creating this website to record my weekly journal, exercises, and projects. I also experimented with CSS gradients and other design elements to create the navbar and header, trying to make the page visually appealing and cohesive.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Challenges / Problems</strong></p>
        <p>
          One challenge I faced was making the webpage visually appealing. I do think it still needs some refining, but I am currently satisfied with the consistent look. Additionally, setting up the GitHub Pages was something I had done before, but I didnâ€™t fully remember the process. Fortunately, I was able to figure it out with help from online tutorials.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Goals for Next Week</strong></p>
        <p>
          Next week, I plan to improve my website further more and work on the first project and in-class exercises.
